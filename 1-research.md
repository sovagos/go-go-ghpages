### Obvious Mistakes in a Strategically Simple College Admissions Environment (Job Market Paper)
(joint with [Ran I. Shorrer](http://rshorrer.weebly.com/))

<div style="text-align: justify"> In a centralized marketplace that was designed to be simple, we identify participants whose choices are dominated. Using administrative data from Hungary, we show that college applicants make <i>obvious mistakes</i>: they forgo the free option for a tuition waiver worth thousands of dollars. We show that at least 10 percent of the applicants made such mistakes in 2013. Costly mistakes have externalities: they transfer tuition waivers from high- to low-socioeconomic status students, and raise the number of students attending college. To shed light on the underlying mechanism driving mistakes, we exploit a reform that made admission with financial aid substantially more selective in some fields of study. We find that increased program selectivity raised the probability of making obvious mistakes, especially among high-socioeconomic status and low-achieving applicants. Our results suggest that applicants with a lower expected loss from mistakes make more of them. </div> ([link](https://ssrn.com/abstract=2993538))
