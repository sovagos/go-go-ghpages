## Obvious Mistakes in a Strategically Simple College Admissions Environment: Causes and Consequences
(joint with [Ran I. Shorrer](http://rshorrer.weebly.com/))

<div style="text-align: justify"> Although many centralized school admission systems use strategically simple mechanisms, applicants often make dominated choices. Using administrative data from Hungary, we show that many college applicants forgo the free opportunity to receive a tuition waiver. We provide causal evidence that applicants make more such mistakes when applying to programs where tuition waivers are more selective. A non-negligible share of these mistakes are consequential, costing applicants approximately 3,000 dollars. Costly mistakes transfer waivers from high- to low-socioeconomic status students, and increase the number of admitted students. Our results suggest that mistakes are more common when their expected utility cost is lower. </div> ([link](https://ssrn.com/abstract=2993538))

## Priority Rules in School Assignment
(joint with [Monique de Haan](http://www.moniquedehaan.nl/), [Pieter Gautier](https://sites.google.com/site/pietgautier/), [Hessel Oosterbeek](http://oosterbeek.economists.nl/), and [Bas van der Klaauw](http://personal.vu.nl/b.vander.klaauw/))
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify"> The Student-proposing Deferred Acceptance Mechanism (DA) does not respond to students’ cardinal preferences, which entails inefficiencies. However, DA complemented with priority rules that are correlated with the intensity of student preferences may overcome these inefficiencies. To study the effect of priority rules in school assignment on student welfare, we combine administrative and survey data on school choice and student preferences from the school district of Utrecht. We compare student welfare under different school assignment mechanisms: DA with random tie-breaking, DA with priority rules, and choice-augmented DA. In the choice-augmented DA mechanism, students submit a rank-ordered list of schools and name a target school where they have priority (Abdulkadiroglu et al., 2015). We consider three priority rules: distance priority, sibling priority, and priority of high-achieving students in academically oriented high-schools. First, we show that these priorities are correlated with students’ ordinal and cardinal preferences. Second, by comparing counterfactual allocations, we find that choice-augmented DA results in a minor welfare improvement relative to DA. DA complemented with distance-to-school-based priority yields the highest student welfare. Survey-based and estimated measures of cardinal utility are highly correlated and rank the different school assignment mechanisms similarly. </div>

## The Impact of Elite High-Schools on Academic Performance: A Non-Parametric Bounds Approach
(joint with [János Divényi](http://divenyijanos.github.io/))

<div style="text-align: justify"> Elite schools attract high-achieving students whose academic performance stands out. Does the achievement gap between elite and non-elite school students stem purely from selection, or elite schools have value-added as well? We study the effect of elite high-school attendance on short-term academic performance in Hungary. Hungarian elite high-schools track students at age 10 and 12 and offer special curriculum in addition to the high peer-quality. Our research design provides non-parametric bounds on the effect of elite schools for those who actually attend them. For identification purposes, we assume that more able students select into the elite high-schools, and that these high-schools do not impair the performance of participants. We tighten the bounds further using parental education and the number of books at home as monotone instruments. We find that selection explains at least half of the achievement gap in numeracy and literacy test scores between elite and non-elite school students. However, we do not find evidence that the lower bound of the effect of elite high-schools on short-term academic achievement is positive. </div>

## The Effect of the UI Benefit on Labor Market Outcomes - Regression Kink Evidence from the Netherlands

<div style="text-align: justify">  This paper studies the impact of the size of unemployment insurance (UI) benefit on labor market outcomes. To estimate the causal effect of the UI benefit on unemployment duration and re-employment job quality, I exploit the kink caused by the capped UI benefit policy rule. The fuzzy regression kink design estimates suggest that more generous UI increases the duration of receiving UI benefits and the time that unemployed workers need to find a new job. However, there is no evidence that the UI benefit improves re-employment wages or the number of working hours. I assess various aspects of the optimality of the Dutch UI system by calibrating the Baily-Chetty formula. </div>
