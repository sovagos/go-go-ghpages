## Why are schools segregated? Evidence from the secondary-school match in Amsterdam
(joint with [Hessel Oosterbeek](http://oosterbeek.economists.nl/) and [Bas van der Klaauw](http://personal.vu.nl/b.vander.klaauw/))

<div style="text-align: justify"> We use rich data from the secondary-school match in Amsterdam to decompose school segregation by ethnicity and household income into five additive sources: i) ability tracking, ii) noise, iii) residential segregation, iv) preference heterogeneity, and v) capacity constraints. Important features of the Amsterdam school district are that students can freely choose any school at their ability level, school density is high and private schools are absent. We find that school segregation is mainly driven by ability tracking and students from different groups having different preferences. Residential segregation, capacity constraints and noise play only a minor role. Of the four policies that we simulate, affirmative action in the form of minority quotas reduces segregation the most. This comes, however, at the cost of a reduction of student welfare. </div> ([link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/78qigdswxd8ri8b/segregation2018sep.pdf?dl=0)) 


## Obvious Mistakes in a Strategically Simple College Admissions Environment: Causes and Consequences
(joint with [Ran I. Shorrer](http://rshorrer.weebly.com/))

<div style="text-align: justify"> Although many centralized school assignment systems use strategically simple mechanisms, applicants often make dominated choices. Using administrative data from Hungary, we show that many college applicants forgo the free opportunity to receive a tuition waiver. Using two empirical strategies, we provide causal evidence that applicants make more such mistakes when applying to programs where tuition waivers are more selective. First, exploiting a reform that increased the selectivity of admission with a tuition waiver in some programs, we find that the rate of mistakes quadrupled. Second, we show that applicants that apply to multiple programs are more likely to make mistakes in their applications to more selective programs. A non-negligible share of these mistakes are consequential, costing applicants more than 3,000 dollars on average. Costly mistakes transfer tuition waivers from high-- to low-socioeconomic status students, and increase the number of students admitted to college. Our results suggest that mistakes are more common when their expected utility cost is lower. </div> ([link](https://ssrn.com/abstract=2993538))

## Measuring students’ cardinal preferences for schools

<div style="text-align: justify"> This paper compares different approaches to express cardinal preferences of students in terms of their willingness-to-travel to schools. A good measure for cardinal utility is crucial for ranking school assignment mechanisms in terms of expected student welfare. We directly measure willingness-to-travel in a survey and compare this to a structurally estimated willingness-to-travel measure using non-manipulated survey-based ordinal rankings and a measure based on subjective preference points. Only when the ordinal rankings coincide, the different measures are strongly correlated (also within students). For all measures, deferred acceptance yields higher average student welfare than the adaptive immediate acceptance mechanism. Finally, we show that when actual choice data from a non-strategy proof mechanism are used to estimate willingness-to-travel, the absence of information on the rank-ordered lists causes a low correlation in willingness-to-travel with directly measured willingness-to-travel. </div>

## The Impact of Elite High-Schools on Academic Performance: A Non-Parametric Bounds Approach
(joint with [János Divényi](http://divenyijanos.github.io/))

<div style="text-align: justify"> Elite schools attract high-achieving students whose academic performance stands out. Does the achievement gap between elite and non-elite school students stem purely from selection, or elite schools have value-added as well? We study the effect of elite high-school attendance on short-term academic performance in Hungary. Hungarian elite high-schools track students at age 10 and 12 and offer special curriculum in addition to the high peer-quality. Our research design provides non-parametric bounds on the effect of elite schools for those who actually attend them. For identification purposes, we assume that more able students select into the elite high-schools, and that these high-schools do not impair the performance of participants. We tighten the bounds further using parental education and the number of books at home as monotone instruments. We find that selection explains at least half of the achievement gap in numeracy and literacy test scores between elite and non-elite school students. However, we do not find evidence that the lower bound of the effect of elite high-schools on short-term academic achievement is positive. </div>

## The Effect of the UI Benefit on Labor Market Outcomes - Regression Kink Evidence from the Netherlands

<div style="text-align: justify">  This paper studies the impact of the size of unemployment insurance (UI) benefit on labor market outcomes. To estimate the causal effect of the UI benefit on unemployment duration and re-employment job quality, I exploit the kink caused by the capped UI benefit policy rule. The fuzzy regression kink design estimates suggest that more generous UI increases the duration of receiving UI benefits and the time that unemployed workers need to find a new job. However, there is no evidence that the UI benefit improves re-employment wages or the number of working hours. I assess various aspects of the optimality of the Dutch UI system by calibrating the Baily-Chetty formula. </div>
