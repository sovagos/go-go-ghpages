### Obvious Mistakes in a Strategically Simple College Admissions Environment (Job Market Paper)
(joint with [Ran I. Shorrer](http://rshorrer.weebly.com/))

<div style="text-align: justify"> In a centralized marketplace that was designed to be simple, we identify participants whose choices are dominated. Using administrative data from Hungary, we show that college applicants make <i>obvious mistakes</i>: they forgo the free opportunity to receive a tuition waiver worth thousands of dollars. At least 10 percent of the applicants made such mistakes in 2013. Costly mistakes have externalities: they transfer tuition waivers from high- to low-socioeconomic status students, and increase the number of students attending college. To shed light on the mechanisms underlying mistakes, we exploit a reform that substantially increased the selectivity of admission with financial aid in some fields of study. Increased admission selectivity raises the likelihood of making obvious mistakes, especially among high-socioeconomic status and low-achieving applicants. Our results suggest that mistakes are more common when their expected cost is lower. Still, the average cost of a mistake in 2013 was 114-365 dollars. </div> ([link](https://ssrn.com/abstract=2993538))

### The Impact of Elite High-Schools on Academic Performance: A Non-Parametric Bounds Approach
(joint with [János Divényi](http://divenyijanos.github.io/))

<div style="text-align: justify"> Selective schools attract high-achieving students whose academic performance stands out. Does this achievement gap stem purely from selection, or selective schools have value-added as well? We study the effect of elite high-school attendance on short-term academic performance in Hungary. Hungarian elite high-schools track students at age 10 and 12 and offer special curriculum in addition to the high peer-quality. Our research design provides non-parametric bounds on the effect of elite schools for those who actually attend them. For identification purposes, we assume that more able students select into the elite high-schools, and that these high-schools do not impair the performance of participants. We tighten the bounds further using parental education and the number of books at home as monotone instruments. We find that selection explains at least half of the achievement gap in numeracy and literacy test scores between elite and non-elite school pupils. However, we do not find evidence that the lower bound of the effect of elite high-schools on short-term academic achievement is positive. </div>
