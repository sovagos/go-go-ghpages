I have been a teaching assistant for several courses in Economics and Econometrics on both undergraduate and graduate-level in the past years. I was awarded the [Teaching Assistant of the Year Award](http://www.tinbergen.nl/student-council/teaching-assistant-and-lecturer-of-the-year/) at Tinbergen Institute in 2015, and I was a nominee for the Best Lecturer Award at Vrije University Amsterdam in 2017. I am thrilled to debute as a lecturer for the Microeconomics and Methods course in the autumn.
