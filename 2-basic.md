<p align = "justify"> I have been instructing several courses in Economics and Econometrics on both undergraduate and graduate-level as a teaching assisant over the recent years. I won the <a href = "http://www.tinbergen.nl/student-council/teaching-assistant-and-lecturer-of-the-year/">Teaching Assistant of the Year Award</a> at Tinbergen Institute in 2015, and I was nominated for the Best Lecturer Award at Vrije University Amsterdam in 2017. </p> 
I am thrilled to debut as a lecturer for the Microeconomics and Methods course in October, 2017.
