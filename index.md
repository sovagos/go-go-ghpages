My research interest lies in applied microeconomics, in particural, I am interested in policy evaluation in the fields of education, labor economics, and market design. <br> <br> After completing a Master's in Economics at the Corvinus University of Budapest, I obtained an MPhil degree at the Tinbergen Institute in 2014.
