Welcome to my website,

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](vu-economics.nl) and [Tinbergen Institute](www.tinbergen.nl). My research interest lies in applied microeconomics, in particural in policy evaluation in the field of education, labor economics, and market design. After completing a Master's in Economics at the Corvinus University of Budapest, I obtained an MPhil degree at the Tinbergen Institute in 2014. Recently, I was a visiting PhD student at the London School of Economics and Pennsylvania State University. My advisors are [Bas van der Klaauw](http://personal.vu.nl/b.vander.klaauw/) and [Thomas Buser](https://sites.google.com/site/thomasbuser/).

**Research interests**: Education, Labor, Market Design, Policy Evaluation
