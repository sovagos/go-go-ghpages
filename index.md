| <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/IMG_5500-Bearbeitet.jpg" alt="picture" style="width:90%;" > | Welcome, <br> <br> I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](http://vu-economics.nl) and [Tinbergen Institute](http://tinbergen.nl), advised by [Bas van der Klaauw](http://personal.vu.nl/b.vander.klaauw/) and [Thomas Buser](https://sites.google.com/site/thomasbuser/).|
| | My research interest lies in <b>applied microeconomics</b>, in particular, I am interested in policy evaluation in the fields of education economics, labor economics, and market design. My job market paper, titled, [Obvious Mistakes in a Strategically Simple College Admissions Environment](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2993538) provides direct field evidence on dominated-strategy play in college admission. The paper shows that applicants, whose expected cost of making an obvious mistake is low, are more likely to make an obvious mistake. <br> <br> I will be available for interviews at the SAEe meeting in Barcelona and at the ASSA Annual Meeting in Philadelphia. <br> <br> On this site, you can find out more about [my research](https://sovagos.github.io/1-research.html), learn about my [teaching activity](https://sovagos.github.io/2-basic.html), read my [academic CV](https://sovagos.github.io/3-CV.html), or [get in touch](https://sovagos.github.io/4-jekyll-advanced.html). |
