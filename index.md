    <td align = "justify"><br> My job market paper, titled <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2993538">Obvious Mistakes in a Strategically Simple College Admissions Environment</a>, documents that, even though centralized admission is designed to be simple, college applicants forgo the free option for a tuition waiver worth thousands of dollars. Costly mistakes promote equity and raise the number of students attending college. As a main contribution, the paper provides causal evidence that admission selectivity increases the likelihood of making mistakes. <br> <br> I will present my job market paper in the poster session of the ASSA Annual Meeting in Philadelphia, and will be available for interviews there. I will also attend the SAEe meeting in Barcelona. <br> <br> On this site, you can find out more about <a href="https://sovagos.github.io/1-research.html">my research</a>, learn about my <a href="https://sovagos.github.io/2-basic.html">teaching activity</a>, read my <a href="https://sovagos.github.io/3-CV.html">academic CV</a>, or <a href="https://sovagos.github.io/4-contact.html">get in touch with me</a>, or with the placement director of Tinbergen Institute, <a href="mailto:e.j.bartelsman@tinbergen.nl">Prof. Eric Bartelsman</a>. </td>
