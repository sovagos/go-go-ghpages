    <td align = "justify"><br> My job market paper, titled <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2993538">Obvious Mistakes in a Strategically Simple College Admissions Environment</a>, provides direct field evidence on dominated-strategy play in a high-stakes environment, which is designed to be simple. The paper investigates the causes and consequences of dominated-strategy play, and shows that program-selectivity has a large, positive causal effect on dominated-strategy play. The empirical findings suggest that applicants with lower expected loss from mistakes are making more of them. <br> <br> I am on the job market in 2018, I will be available for interviews at the SAEe meeting in Barcelona and the ASSA Annual Meeting in Philadelphia. <br> <br> On this site, you can find out more about <a href="https://sovagos.github.io/1-research.html">my research</a>, learn about my <a href="https://sovagos.github.io/2-basic.html">teaching activity</a>, read my <a href="https://sovagos.github.io/3-CV.html">academic CV</a>, or <a href="https://sovagos.github.io/4-contact.html">get in touch</a>. </td>
